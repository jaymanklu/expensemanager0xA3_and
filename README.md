It provides for maintaining all these data in a locally held SQLite database of android. It can display all the past expenditures, incomes and debt information and provide automated support to update entries.

Go ahead use this codebase to build something upon it, or just use it as-is for a project or something academic, STRICTLY for non-commercial, academic or reference purposes. Its you who has to add commercial value to it by extending the functionality, because, this version's been already commercially exploited unless you want a duplicate up there.
